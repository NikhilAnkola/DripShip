# DripShip

A MERN Stack based e-commerce project inspired by the dropshipping business model, built using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.

Although the original goal was to build a complete dropshipping platform with advanced supplier-side workflow, due to project timeline constraints, the current implementation focuses on the core e-commerce functionalities such as authentication, product browsing, cart management, and protected user actions.

This project was developed as a solo academic micro-project to demonstrate full-stack MERN development concepts including frontend-backend integration, JWT authentication, MongoDB data handling, and responsive UI design.

---

## Project Overview

DripShip allows users to:

- Register and create an account
- Login securely using JWT Authentication
- Browse products dynamically from MongoDB
- View product details
- Add products to cart
- Remove products from cart
- View total cart price
- Use Remember Me functionality
- Use Show/Hide Password functionality
- Experience login attempt limiting after multiple failed attempts
- Navigate through animated product gallery with pagination

The project simulates the foundation of a dropshipping/e-commerce platform where users can browse and manage products before future expansion into supplier integration, payment systems, and order management.

## MongoDB Database Design
### User Schema
{
  name,
  username,
  email,
  password,
  cart: [
    {
      productId
    }
  ]
}

### Product Schema
{
  name,
  price,
  image,
  description
}

## Installation & Setup
### Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DripShip.git
cd DripShip
### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies
npm install
### Step 3: Install Backend Dependencies
cd backend
npm install
### Step 4: Create .env File

Inside the backend folder, create a .env file:

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/DripShip
### Step 5: Start Frontend
npm start

Frontend runs on:

http://localhost:3000
### Step 6: Start Backend

Open a new terminal:

cd backend
node server.js

Backend runs on:

http://localhost:5000

## API Routes
### User Routes
POST   /api/users/register
POST   /api/users/login
GET    /api/users
### Product Routes
GET    /api/products
GET    /api/products/:id
### Cart Routes
POST   /api/cart/add
GET    /api/cart
DELETE /api/cart/remove/:

## Current Limitations

This is important for honesty and realistic project presentation.

Currently the project does NOT include:

- Payment Gateway Integration
- Admin Dashboard
- Order Tracking
- Supplier Integration
- Inventory Sync
- Automated Dropshipping Workflow
- Wishlist Backend Logic
- Product Quantity Management
- Checkout System

The project currently functions as a strong MERN e-commerce foundation rather than a complete production-ready dropshipping platform.

## Future Improvements

Possible future upgrades:

- Razorpay / Stripe Payment Integration
- Admin Dashboard
- Product Quantity System
- Order History & Tracking
- Wishlist Backend
- Supplier-side Dropshipping Integration
- Automated Order Processing
- Inventory Management
- Product Search & Filters
- Full Production Deployment

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I learned:

- MERN stack architecture
- REST API development
- JWT Authentication
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Protected routes using middleware
- MongoDB schema design
- React state management
- Frontend + Backend integration
- LocalStorage usage
- Real-world debugging and deployment structure

## Final Note

DripShip started as a complete dropshipping platform idea, but due to time constraints, it evolved into a fully functional MERN-based e-commerce system with authentication and cart management.

Rather than pretending unfinished features exist, this project honestly represents a strong practical implementation of full-stack development fundamentals and serves as a solid base for future expansion.
